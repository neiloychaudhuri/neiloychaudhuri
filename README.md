## 👋 Hi, I’m Neiloy

I’m a **Management Engineering student at the University of Waterloo** working as a **software engineer**.

I enjoy building practical, well designed products, moving fast from idea to implementation, and learning by shipping real things. I’m especially interested in full stack development, developer tools, and product driven engineering.

## 🚀 Projects

Here are a few things I’ve built or am actively working on:

### [CyberCtrl](https://devpost.com/software/devguard)
A Chrome extension that scans APIs, dependencies, and libraries for security risks and tradeoffs using AI. Built for HackNYU.

### Full Stack Web Apps
Product focused applications with real users, clean UI, and end to end functionality. Check out [ImpostorGPT](https://github.com/neiloychaudhuri/ImpostorGPT)!
